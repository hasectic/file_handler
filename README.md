Categorize the file into specific folder or in file according to month ,type,size,date, creation time etc..
This project contains programmes for file mangement
1 if you want to categorize all your file according to size , type(.exe, .jpg, .doc) or according to modification or creation date,
2. if you want to merge 2 folder into 3rd folder with the the name of 1_2 you can do it by my programms.

let me tell how it will work
1.  newfold.java 
 this program can pick any 2 file from the directory path folder (randomly) and merge it and save it in a folder with the name of 2 files
 e.g
   in directory  there are 1.txt , 2.txt, 4.txt,11.txt , 20.txt, 14.txt etc
   this program can pick any 2 files like 4.txt and 20.txt and then make it a folder in url path or output directory
   the folder name will become 4_20 and in this folder 4.txt contents and 20.txt content will merge with the name 4_20.txt. 
2. type.java
  this program will calssify all the file in the folder by their type like all jpg will store in dynamically created jpg foolder and .pdf file will store in pdf folder.
3.  month_date.java
   thsi program can classify all the files in 3 ways
   by date
   by month 
  by  year
 e.g all files which is created in 2011 will store in dynmaically created folder 2011
   or  february monnth can store all files of feb
4.ss.java 
  this program can be used to categorize the files according to size like
  all 1mb or <1mb files will store in 1mb named folder
and 5 mb or <5mb  will be in 5mb folder

open all the program there are all the details for specific program
