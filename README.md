Categorize the file into specific folder or in file according to month ,type,size,date, creation time etc..
This pproject is a system for file mangement
1 if you want to categorize all your file according to size , type(.exe, .jpg, .doc) or according to modification or creation date,
2. if you want to merge 2 folder into 3rd folder with the the name of 1_2 you can do it by my programms.

let me tell how it will work
 1 newfold.java 
 this program can pick any 2 file from the directory path folder (randomly) and merge it and save it in a folder with the name of 2 files
 e.g
   in directory  there are 1.txt , 2.txt, 4.txt,11.txt , 20.txt, 14.txt etc
   this program can pick any 2 files like 4.txt and 20.txt and then make it a folder in url path or output directory
   the folder name will become 4_20 and in this folder 4.txt contents and 20.txt content will merge.
